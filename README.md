BetterSnap
==========

An alternative to the built-in Windows snap feature.  
I made this because when I have 3 or more windows open at once, I'm fairly obsessive about getting all the borders to align perfectly.  
If you're like me or you want an example of how to use some basic Windows API functions in Python, you might enjoy this.
####Description
This script will virtually divide the display into an n by m grid, where n and m are numbers set by the contents of settings.cfg .  
When executed, the borders of all open windows will snap to the nearest grid line, thereby allowing a much more customizable window layout.  
The borders also overlap to squeeze a few more pixels out of the screen space.
####Usage
Roughly position your windows
